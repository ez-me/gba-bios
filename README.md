# gba-bios
open-source GBA BIOS replacement

## Who, and why

This replacement BIOS was (from what I can gather) made originally by the [VisualBoyAdvance-M](https://github.com/visualboyadvance-m/visualboyadvance-m/) folks, later modified by [Normmatt](https://github.com/Normmatt/).

The files were extracted from the [ReGBA emulator](https://github.com/Nebuleon/ReGBA/tree/master/bios) as explained in a [GBAtemp forum comment](https://gbatemp.net/threads/normatts-gba-bios-source-code.575969/#post-9242063) of that being the source of the one in their [downloads page](https://gbatemp.net/download/normatts-open-source-gba-bios-compiled.35225/).

The License of the [VBA-M emulator is the GPLv2](https://github.com/visualboyadvance-m/visualboyadvance-m/blob/master/doc/License.txt), and since that license cannot change between forks, that's the one in this repo.
